## Key Features

-   **AI-powered Pneumonia Detection:** Utilizes a deep learning model for accurate pneumonia detection in chest X-ray images.
-   **Grad-CAM Visualization:** Provides visual explanations highlighting the areas of the X-ray image the AI focused on for its diagnosis, enhancing transparency and trust.
-   **User-Friendly Web Interface:** A clean and intuitive web interface allows easy image uploads and result interpretation.
-   **REST API:** A well-documented API enabling integration with other medical systems.

## Tech Stack

-   **Python:** The primary programming language.
-   **Flask:** A micro web framework for building the API and web interface.
-   **PyTorch:** An open-source machine learning framework used for model training and inference.
-   **Torchvision:** PyTorch's library for computer vision tasks, including image transformations and model architectures.
-   **scikit-learn:** Machine learning library.
-   **opencv-python**: Image processing library.
-   **numpy**: For numerical computations.
-   **PIL (Pillow):** Python Imaging Library for image handling.
-   **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** For building the web interface.
-   **Bootstrap:** A CSS framework for styling the web interface.
-   **gunicorn**: WSGI server.

## Setup Instructions

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]  <- Replace with your repository URL
    cd [repository_name]       <- Replace with your repository name
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**

    *   On macOS and Linux:

        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```

    *   On Windows:

        ```bash
        .venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Place the model**: Confirm that `best_model.pth` is placed in the same directory where `app.py` is.

6.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

7.  **Open your web browser:** Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the application.

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Upload an X-ray image:** Use the file upload form to select a chest X-ray image from your computer. Supported formats include JPEG, PNG, and DICOM.
2.  **View the diagnosis:** The AI model will analyze the image and display the prediction results, including the probability of pneumonia being present.
3.  **Interpret the Grad-CAM visualization:** The Grad-CAM visualization will highlight the regions of the X-ray image that the AI focused on when making its diagnosis. Brighter areas indicate higher attention.

## Model Training

The deep learning model was trained using the [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) dataset from Kaggle.
[Describe your training process briefly. What were the main steps? What were the main challenges?]
The training process was performed in Google Colab using a ResNet18 architecture. See the `Colab_Notebook.ipynb` notebook for details on the training procedure.

## Future Improvements

-   Support for more image formats (e.g., DICOM).
-   Improved Grad-CAM visualizations (e.g., higher resolution, better color schemes).
-   Integration with medical record systems.
-   Deployment to a cloud platform for wider accessibility.
-   Implementation of unit tests for increased code reliability.
-   Incorporate user feedback to improve model accuracy and usability.
